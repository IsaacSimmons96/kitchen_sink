# Kitchen Sink :shower:

A GUI library that has everything but the kitchen sink!

Kitchen Sink is a WIP work of passion from me and at the moment is not intended for public use.
However im happy youve found this and might be interested!

## Background of Kitchen Sink

Kitchen Sink was my solution to a problem. What was the problem you ask?
Ill tell you.

I play a lot of [Dungeons and Dragons (D&D)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) in my spare time. I mainly take the role of the Dungeon Master.
The Dungeon Master role requires alot of thinking on your feet, especially where making non player characters (npcs) is concerned.
I wanted to make a small C++ program to randomly generate some D&D NPCs to help me out in a jiffy.
The problem was is that I couldnt find a GUI library that I liked.
So as a UI Programmer, I took it upon myself to write one from scratch, using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) as a base for the graphics.

So far Kitchen Sink has been a great journey and ive improved my own skills alot. Im looking forward to alot more work!

The original DND project has been put on hold for now as I focus more on Kitchen Sink.
It didnt get real far anyway, but if your curious you can find it [here](https://github.com/IsaacSimmons96/dnd_npc_maker).

## Why is it called Kitchen Sink ?
I found it hard to think of a cool GUI name.
Then i thought of the phrase ["Everything but the Kitchen Sink"](https://wordhistories.net/2017/09/06/everything-but-kitchen-sink/) and here we are.
